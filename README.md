## 3. Process
[Back to Top](#about-bellabeat)

R Studio was chosen for this analysis due to its abundant packages and data visualization features that facilitate thorough data exploration.

#### Environment Setup
Install and load the packages.
```
# Install the packages
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("janitor")
install.packages("skimr")
install.packages("lubridate")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")

# Load the packages
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(skimr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```
Select the directory of the file for the datasets to be imported from.<br>
_Keyboard shortcut: **CRTL + SHIFT + H**_
```
# Set working directory
setwd("C:/Users/DELL/Downloads/bellabeat/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16")
head(list.files())
```
This analysis will focus on dailyActivity, dailyCalories, dailySteps, and dailySleep datasets.
Importing the datasets.
```
# Importing datasets
daily_activity <- read.csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
daily_calories <- read.csv("dailyCalories_merged.csv")
daily_steps <- read.csv("dailySteps_merged.csv")
daily_sleep <- read.csv("sleepDay_merged.csv")
```

#### Cleaning the data
Inspect data for any formatting errors.
```
# Inspect format errors
str(daily_activity)
str(daily_calories)
str(daily_steps)
str(daily_sleep)
```
![Format Error Image](images/format_error1.png)
![Format Error Image](images/format_error2.png)

Following a quick review of the output, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:
- daily_activity$ActivityDate ‚Äî Is formatted as CHR, not as a date format
- daily_calories$ActivityDay ‚Äî Is formatted as CHR, not as a date format
- daily_steps$ActivityDay ‚Äî Is formatted as CHR, not as a date format
- daily_sleep$SleepDay ‚Äî Is formatted as CHR, not as a date format, and time is included

To fix those issues, several steps will be done:
- Data in said columns will be converted to a date format.
- By using pipeline, the weekday is determined and inserted into a new column, Weekday, for the analysis. 
- Time included in daily_sleep$SleepDay will be separated as it is not needed in this analysis.
```
# Convert to date & determine weekdays
daily_activity <- daily_activity %>% 
  mutate(ActivityDate = as.Date(ActivityDate,"%m/%d/%Y"),
  Weekday = weekdays(ActivityDate))
daily_calories <- daily_calories %>%
  mutate(ActivityDay = as.Date(ActivityDay, "%m/%d/%Y"),
  Weekday = weekdays(ActivityDay))
daily_steps <- daily_steps %>% 
  mutate(ActivityDay = as.Date(ActivityDay, "%m/%d/%Y"),
  Weekday = weekdays(ActivityDay))
daily_sleep <- daily_sleep %>% 
  mutate(Weekday = weekdays(as.Date(SleepDay, "%m/%d/%Y")))

# Separating date from time
cleaned_daily_sleep <- daily_sleep %>% 
  separate(SleepDay, c("Date", "Time"), " ")

# Converting Date column to date format
cleaned_daily_sleep$Date <- as.Date(cleaned_daily_sleep$Date, "%m/%d/%Y")
```
![Format Error Image](images/format_fix1.png)
![Format Error Image](images/format_fix2.png)

Next, check for duplicates.
```
# Check for duplicates
daily_activity %>% duplicated() %>% sum()
daily_calories %>% duplicated() %>% sum()
daily_steps %>% duplicated() %>% sum()
cleaned_daily_sleep %>% duplicated() %>% sum()
```
![Duplicate Error Image](images/duplicate_error.png)

cleaned_daily_sleep dataset has 3 duplicates; thus, it needs to be removed.
```
# Removing duplicates & check again
cleaned_daily_sleep <- cleaned_daily_sleep %>% distinct() %>% drop_na()
cleaned_daily_sleep %>% duplicated() %>% sum()
```
![Duplicate Error Image](images/duplicate_fix.png)

Then, check the number of participants in each dataset.
```
# Checking number of participants
n_distinct(daily_activity$Id)
n_distinct(daily_calories$Id)
n_distinct(daily_steps$Id)
n_distinct(cleaned_daily_sleep$Id)
```
![Participants Number Image](images/num_participants.png)

#### Merging the data
Finally, combining the data frames for daily_activity and cleaned_daily_sleep will enable us to evaluate potential correlations between the variables in both tables.
```
# Renaming ActivityDate column to Date
daily_activity <- daily_activity %>% rename(Date = ActivityDate)

# Combining daily_activity with cleaned_daily_sleep on both Id & Date
combined_activity_and_sleep <- merge(daily_activity, cleaned_daily_sleep,
                                     by = c("Id", "Date"))
```
<br>

## 4. Analyze
[Back to Top](#about-bellabeat)

#### Statistical summaries 
After cleaning the data, it's time to examine the statistical summaries for daily_activity, daily_steps, and cleaned_daily_sleep datasets.
```
# Statistical summaries
daily_activity %>% 
  select(VeryActiveMinutes, FairlyActiveMinutes, LightlyActiveMinutes,
         SedentaryMinutes) %>%
  summary()
daily_steps %>% select(StepTotal) %>% summary()
cleaned_daily_sleep %>% select(TotalMinutesAsleep) %>% summary()
```
![Statistical Summaries Image](images/summaries.png)

Observations from the statistical summaries above:
- The majority of the participants are lightly active.
- The average sedentary minutes were 991.2, which is 16.5 hours a day.
- The average number of steps per day is 7638.
- The average time spent asleep was 419.2 minutes, which equates to 7 hours per day.
<br>

#### Further analysis
Visualizations depicting the relationships between the variables within the datasets were created.<br>

Finding the relationship between average steps and weekdays:
```
# Compute average steps per day
average_steps_per_day <- daily_steps %>%
  group_by(Weekday) %>%
  summarise(AverageSteps = mean(StepTotal))

# Placing weekdays in order
daily_steps$Weekday <- factor(
  daily_steps$Weekday, levels = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday",
                                  "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))

# Visualise average steps per day
ggplot(average_steps_per_day, aes(x = Weekday, y = AverageSteps)) +
  geom_col(fill = 'skyblue') +
  labs(title = "Average Steps Taken per Day", x = "Day of the Week",
       y = "Average Steps")
```
![Average Steps Per Day Image](images/avg_steps.png)

Upon analyzing the bar graph showing the average daily steps, it's evident that users tend to take the most steps on Tuesdays and Saturdays, followed by Mondays and Wednesdays. In contrast, they take the fewest steps on Sundays.

Next, finding the relationship between total steps and calories burned:
```
# Visualise total steps against calories burned
ggplot(daily_activity, aes(x = TotalSteps, y = Calories)) +
  geom_point(color = 'orange') + geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "Total Steps vs Calories Burned", x = "Total Steps", y =
      "Calories Burned")
```
![Step Vs Calories Image](images/steps_calories.png)

```
# Compute the correlation between total steps and calories burned
cor(daily_activity$TotalSteps, daily_activity$Calories, method = "pearson")
```
![Steps & Calories Correlation Image](images/corr_steps_calories.png)

By examining the scatterplot and the computed correlation coefficient between total steps and calories burned, it is evident that there is a strong positive relationship between these two variables. As users' total steps increase, the amount of calories burned also increases. This is supported by the correlation coefficient being closer to 1.

Finding the relationship between total minutes asleep and sedentary minutes:
```
# Visualise total minutes asleep against sedentary minutes
ggplot(combined_activity_and_sleep,
       aes(x = TotalMinutesAsleep, y = SedentaryMinutes)) + 
  geom_point(color = 'maroon') + geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "Total Minutes Asleep vs Sedentary Minutes",
       x = "Total Minutes Asleep", y = "Sedentary Minutes")
```
![Sleep Vs Sedentary Image](images/sleep_sedentary.png)

```
# Compute the correlation between total minutes asleep and sedentary minutes
cor(combined_activity_and_sleep$TotalMinutesAsleep,
  combined_activity_and_sleep$SedentaryMinutes, method = "pearson")
```
![Sleep & Sedentary Correlation Image](images/corr_sleep_sedentary.png)

After looking at the scatterplot and the computed correlation coefficient above, it's apparent that there exists a negative correlation between SedentaryMinutes and TotalMinutesAsleep. This implies that users who become less active tend to get less sleep.

Lastly, finding the relationship between total minutes asleep and total minutes in bed :
```
# Visualise total minutes asleep against total minutes in bed
ggplot(cleaned_daily_sleep, aes(x = TotalMinutesAsleep, y = TotalTimeInBed)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = 'Total Minutes Asleep vs Total Minutes in Bed',
       x = 'Total Minutes Asleep', y = 'Total Minutes in Bed')
```
![Sleep Vs Bed Image](images/sleep_bed.png)

```
# Compute the correlation between total minutes asleep and total minutes in bed
cor(combined_activity_and_sleep$TotalMinutesAsleep,
    combined_activity_and_sleep$TotalTimeInBed, method = "pearson")
```
![Sleep & Bed Correlation Image](images/corr_sleep_bed.png)

The scatterplot clearly shows a linear relationship between total minutes in bed and total minutes asleep. This is supported by the calculated correlation coefficient close to 1, indicating a strong relationship between these variables.

#### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn:
- Though the average daily steps are above 6,000, users‚Äô average sedentary minutes is too high, which is 16.5 hours a day, and they are also mostly lightly active.
- Users who are active during the day and prepare for bed early get more sleep.
- As total steps increase, the amount of calories burned increases.

#### Product Recommendations
- Bellabeat‚Äôs Leaf and Time should incorporate an alert system that notifies users when they‚Äôve been sedentary for too long.
- A reward system like personalized badges or an AI companion that celebrates every positive lifestyle progression should be implemented to motivate users to be more active.
- Improve or add a product that could track sleep better, like sleep phases and time spent in each phase.
- Bellabeat should consider adding gentle sleep reminders to their products for users to prepare for bed early.

#### Marketing Strategy Recommendations
- Bellabeat could explore partnerships with brands in wellness, sports, and health industries to offer incentives such as coupons or store discounts to users who consistently maintain a healthy lifestyle.
- Bellabeat could host a lucky draw on their app with chances to win one of their products.
